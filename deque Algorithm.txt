1. Initialize a queue (let's call it "Queue") to store new degree verification application with required documents.
	i. Push new applications in Queue.

2. Initialize an empty deque (let's call it "Deque") to process the applications.

3. While there are applications in the Queue:
   a. Repeat the following until Queue is empty:
      i.   pop the current applications from the front of Queue and push to the rear of the Deque. set Queue (front + 1)
      ii.  Use a verification method to check if all the required documents are available in the Deque.
      iii. If all documents are available:
            1. Set Deque (Rear + 1) to move to the next location to store the next document.
      	   else (required document is missing:)
            1. Delete the current document and repeat the process.

4. Repeat the following until Deque is empty:
   a. Perform the degree verification procedure on current application in the Deque.
   b. If the degree is verified:
      i.   Generate a degree certificate for the student and move it to another queue (RecordQueue) to keep the record.
      iii. set Deque (front + 1)

5. The RecordQueue now contains all the verified degree applications along with their degree certificates, ready for students to collect.
